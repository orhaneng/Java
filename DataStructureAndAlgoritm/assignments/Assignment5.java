/*
 * -Create a program for simulating the fortune unix command. 
 * -The file that contains fortunes uses % in a single line to separate fortune statements. 
 * -The fortune command mist parse the file and represent in memory and then select at 
 * random one statement and print that every time invoked.
 * -We assume that the contents of the file fit in memory properly and is not too big.
   -If empty statement in the fortune file is empty then if that statement is selected at 
random, an empty string must be printed.
   -Statements may be multiline and they should be printed verbatim if that is the case.
As an example:
Your fortune is bad today!
%
No Fortune Today! Sorry.
%
Today is a good day...
To play the lottery
%
%
Sorry not much fortune today!
%
There are 5 statements above so your program must parse the file and find that out and 
store the string in some data structure then select a number between 0 and 4 if 2 is 
selected the following must be printed:
Today is a good day...

To play the lottery
