1-Write a function 	that prints out ASCII-art in the stage of the capital letter L,made up of 
copies of the capital letter L. Parameter N is an integer (between 1 and 100) and represents
the expected size of the ASCII-art (the output should comprise N rows, the last of which 
should comprise N letters L.

For example, here is the output for N=4:
L
L
L
LLLL

The function shouldnt return any value.
you can print a string to the output (without or with the end-of-line character) as follows;
System.out.println();
System.out.print();

2-An automatic judgement system checks a solution for the task on multiple test cases. The
 outcome of a test case is binary; either the solution succeeds of fails. But not all test 
 cases are equally important. Each test cases is assigned to a group, and every test cases 
 group is worth the same number of points.
 
 You have received a raw report with the results of the automatic testing. The report 
 consist of two tables, test_groups and test_cases, with the following structure;
 
 create table test_groups(
 name varchar(40) not null,
 test_value integer not null,
 unique(name)
);


 create table test_cases(
 id integer not null,
 group_name varchar(40) not null,
 status varchar(5) not null,
 unique(id)
);



each row of the table test_groups contains information about a single group of tests;
unique name(name) and the value of each test in the group (test_value). Each row of the table 
test_cases contains information about a single test case: unique id(id), the name of the group
to which it belongs (group_name) and status (status). Status contains either one of two possible
words:ok, error

write an sql query that summarizes each group of tests. The table of results should contain
four columns: name (name of the group), all_test_cases(number of test in task)

examples 
1.given	
test groups;
name                       test value
performance                15
corner cases               10
numerical stability        20
memory usage               10

test_cases
id    group_name             status
13    memory usage           OK
14    numerical stability    OK
15    memory usage           ERROR
16    numerical stability    OK
17    numerical stability    OK
18    performance            ERROR
19    performance            ERROR
20    memory usage           OK
21    numerical stability    OK

YOU SHOULD RETURN
name                   all_test_cases  passed_test_cases  total_value
numerical stability    4               4                   80  
memory usage           3               2                   20  
corner cases           0               0                   0  
performance            2               0                   0  

assume that:every group_name in the table test_cases also appears as name in the table
test_groups
,,,,,,
SELECT 
   t1.group_name name, COALESCE(count(t1.status),0)
FROM test_cases AS t1
LEFT JOIN test_cases AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
GROUP BY t1.group_name;


SELECT 
   t2.group_name, COALESCE(count(*),0) as all_test_cases
FROM test_cases t1 left join  t2 on t1.id=t2.id 
GROUP BY t2.group_name;

3- you are given a spring mvc application and your task is to build new RESTFul web service.
you should implement two variants of reading the /healthcheck resource using JSON as the response 
data format:
method to read simple healthcheck
a request to GET /healthcheck?format=short should return a simple message:
{"status":"OK"}
Method to read detailed healthcheck
a request to get /healthcheck?format=full should return the application status and current 
time(formatted as an ISO 8601 string);

{"currenttime":"2018-06-06T21:59:36Z","application":OK}
other requirements and hints
1.Performance is not assesed;focus on correctness and code quality
2. if parameters values do not match the specified possible values, you should return HTTP status 
code 400("bad request")
3. responses should have content-type header with appropriate value (application/json)
4.if you need to create multiple classes, you can use nested classes or define multiple 
classes in one source file. 
5.you can use the following libraries and their dependencies
 spring web mvc (v. 5.0.7 release)
 fasterXML jackson, jackson datatype JSR310(v. 2.9.6)
